## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I decided to restart the challenge because I donÂ´t feel comfortable with my first attempt, in this case, I use some of the tips I received, the use of the picture tag, for example, was much easier than using two IMG tags, i will continue doing the challenges to improve my skills


This was very useful

```html
   <picture class="perfume_card_pictures">
     <source
       media="(max-width:762px)"
       srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
       class="perfume_card_piture-mobile/>
     <img
       src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
       class="perfume_card_picture-desktop"
       alt="Gabrielle_Parfum"/>
   </picture>
```

### Useful resources
